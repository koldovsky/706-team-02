            <h3>Blocking Strikes</h3>
            <p>Blocking can involve a variety of techniques. The most common is protecting your head and body with your arms.<br>Boxers are taught to keep their arms up so that can move them quickly to their face to block a punch.</p>
            <p>Another technique is the light footwork. The lighter you are on your feet, the easier it is to evade your attacker.<br>boxer’s stance allows them to shift their weight back and forth between their feet to change direction at a moment’s notice.</p>

            <h3>Striking Accuracy</h3>
            <p>A boxer’s stance will help to ground their strikes.<br>Planting your foot and swinging your hips gives a punch much more power than if you were to just use the strength of your shoulders.</p>
            <p>Although it may not be your original intention to cause your opponent damage in a self-defense situation,<br>doing so can stun or knock out your opponent, giving you time to escape.</p>

            <h3>Discipline</h3>
            <p>A very good lesson in boxing is that you should never seek a fight.<br>The discipline that a boxer must demonstrate in training helps to take the emotion out of the fight so that they can keep a level head.</p>
            <p>If you remain calm, you will be able to see the futility of a fight and hopefully avoid more fights.<br>You will also be able to moderate your strikes and defense</p>
